# Multistep Form

I developed this project as a learning experience for React.js. In this mini project I tried working with formik and yup to build a multistep form. <br />

#### Used Technologies
- React.js
- TailwindCSS
- formik
- yup

#### How to use code

First you should clone the project.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/erfan-amani/bookily
```

After cloning install dependencies:
```bash
npm install 
# or
yarn
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
# or
pnpm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
